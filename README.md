Fill out the form with the information requested and you will see all the information displayed on the next page once submitted. The products should be numbers (not sure why we did that....). This web application requires user authentication.

Program was built and ran with Sublime Text but can be run with any text editor. Package such as XAMPP is required to run a PHP web application on your computer. Please follow this guide to installing XAMPP https://codeofaninja.com/how-to-run-a-php-script/. Simply need to run the HTML file in a browser and the program will work.
